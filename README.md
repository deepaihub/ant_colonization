# ant_colonization

This Python project simulates an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm using visual animations. The simulation models the behavior of ants as they search for food and return to their nest while leaving behind pheromone trails, effectively illustrating how decentralized agents can solve optimization problems through stigmergy (indirect communication via environment).

Note : above 80% of the code is generated using LLM
